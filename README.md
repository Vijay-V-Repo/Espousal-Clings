# Case Study : Espousal-Clings - A Musician Booking App for a Wedding Venue.

# Background
Espousal Clings is a booking application that connects wedding venues with live musicians for their events. The application was created to simplify the process of finding and booking musicians, and to ensure a seamless experience for both venues and musicians.

# Research
To begin the UX design process, we conducted user research to understand the needs of both wedding venues and musicians. We interviewed venue owners and musicians to gain insights into their pain points and challenges when it comes to booking and performing at weddings. We also conducted a competitive analysis to understand the features of existing musician booking applications.

# User Personas
Based on our research, we developed user personas for both wedding venues and musicians. These personas helped us to better understand the needs and motivations of our users, and guided our design decisions throughout the project.

# User Flows
We created user flows for both wedding venues and musicians to map out the process of using the application. These user flows helped us to identify potential pain points and areas for improvement in the user experience.

# Wireframes
Next, we developed low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the layout and structure of the application. These wireframes were iterated upon and refined through user testing and feedback.

# High-Fidelity Mockups
Once the wireframes were finalized, we created high-fidelity mockups that incorporated branding and visual design. These mockups were used to test the usability and functionality of the application with real users.

# Prototyping
We developed a clickable prototype that allowed users to interact with the application and test its features and functionality. This prototype was used for further user testing and feedback.

# User Testing
We conducted user testing with both wedding venues and musicians to gather feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the application. We used this feedback to make iterative improvements to the design and user experience.

# Final Product
After several rounds of iteration and user testing, we launched the final product, Espousal Clings, which is a user-centered musician booking application for wedding venues. The application includes features such as search and filter functionality, musician profiles with samples of their work, and a booking system that simplifies the process of hiring and paying musicians for wedding events.

# Results
The final product was well-received by both wedding venues and musicians, who praised its ease of use and effectiveness in streamlining the booking process. The application has seen significant adoption among its target user base, and has helped to make the process of booking live music for weddings a more enjoyable and seamless experience.
